## Configuration

### Command Line Options

```bash
./famstack [options]

Options:
  -port string
        Server port (default "8080")
  -db string
        Database file path (default "famstack.db")
  -migrate-up
        Run database migrations up
  -migrate-down
        Run database migrations down
  -dev
        Enable development mode
```

### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Server port (overrides -port flag)
- `DATABASE_PATH` - Database file path (overrides -db flag)

## Database

Fam-Stack uses SQLite with the following schema:

- **families** - Family units
- **users** - Family members with roles (parent/child/admin)
- **tasks** - Unified task system (todos/chores/appointments)
- **sessions** - User authentication sessions

### Migrations

Database migrations are handled automatically on startup, but you can also run them manually:

```bash
# Run migrations up
./famstack -migrate-up

# Rollback one migration
./famstack -migrate-down
```

## API

Fam-Stack provides both a web interface and REST API endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration

### Tasks
- `GET /api/tasks` - List tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` - Mark task as complete

### Family Management
- `GET /api/family/members` - List family members
- `POST /api/family/members` - Add family member
- `PATCH /api/family/members/:id` - Update family member

## TypeScript Components

The application includes TypeScript components for enhanced interactivity:

- **TaskManager**: Drag-and-drop task reordering, inline editing
- **FamilySelector**: Multi-select family member assignment
- **Real-time Updates**: HTMX integration for dynamic content

Components are automatically initialized and integrate seamlessly with server-rendered HTML.

## Deployment

### Single Binary

Fam-Stack compiles to a single binary with all assets embedded. Simply copy the binary to your server and run it:

```bash
# Download and run
wget https://github.com/famstack/famstack/releases/latest/download/famstack-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf famstack-linux-amd64.tar.gz
./famstack
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t famstack .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/data:/data famstack -db /data/famstack.db
```

### Systemd Service
